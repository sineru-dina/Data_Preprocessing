# Date Encoding and Decoding

This repository contains my learnings and implementations related to **Date Encoding and Decoding** techniques. These methods are crucial for converting date and time information into formats that can be effectively used in machine learning models or other data processing tasks. The goal of this repository is to explore **Cyclical Encoding** strategy for transforming date and time data, and decoding them back to their original format.

## Key Concepts

1. **Date Encoding**: 
    - This process involves converting dates into numerical representations that machine learning algorithms can understand and process.
    - Common encoding techniques include:
        - **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting each component of a date (e.g., day of the week, month) into binary columns.
        - **Ordinal Encoding**: Representing each component of a date as an integer.
        - **Timestamp Conversion**: Converting dates to Unix timestamps or other numeric formats.
        - **Cyclical Encoding**: Treating certain components like day of the week or month as cyclic features and encoding them accordingly.

2. **Date Decoding**: 
    - Decoding involves converting numerical representations back into readable date or time formats.
    - For example, converting a Unix timestamp back to a human-readable date, or reversing one-hot encoding to identify the actual day of the week.
