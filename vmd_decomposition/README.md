# Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)

## Introduction  
**Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)** is an advanced signal processing technique used to decompose a time series into multiple **intrinsic mode functions (IMFs)**, also known as **modes**. 
Unlike traditional decomposition methods like **Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)**, VMD is a variational approach that adaptively decomposes a signal into its constituent components while ensuring each mode is band-limited.

This repository explores **VMD using sktime**, a powerful time series library in Python. By leveraging `sktime`, we can efficiently apply VMD to **real-world time series data** for analysis and forecasting.

## How VMD Works  
VMD decomposes a signal **iteratively** by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the bandwidth of each mode. The process involves:
1. **Transforming the signal** into the frequency domain.
2. **Updating modes** iteratively using an adaptive optimization approach.
3. **Extracting meaningful components** for analysis and forecasting.

Unlike traditional Fourier Transform methods, VMD allows for **adaptive decomposition**, making it suitable for **nonlinear and nonstationary time series**.

## Why Use VMD?  
ðŸ”¹ Overcomes **mode mixing** issues in EMD.  
ðŸ”¹ Suitable for **nonstationary time series** with complex structures.  
ðŸ”¹ Provides **adaptive and robust decomposition**.  
ðŸ”¹ Works well in **forecasting tasks** when combined with models like SARIMAX, LSTM, etc.

## Applications  
ðŸ”¹ **Financial time series analysis** (stock market trend extraction).  
ðŸ”¹ **Energy demand forecasting** (solar, wind power patterns).  
ðŸ”¹ **Biomedical signal processing** (EEG, ECG signal decomposition).  
ðŸ”¹ **Fault detection in machinery** (vibration signal analysis).
