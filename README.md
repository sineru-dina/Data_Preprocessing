# Data Preprocessing

This repository contains various data preprocessing techniques commonly used in time series analysis and machine learning. It includes implementations and updates for several methods such as Box-Cox transformation, STL decomposition, Weighted Moving Average (WMA), and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD).

## Techniques Implemented

### 1. **Box-Cox Transformation**
   - The Box-Cox transformation is used to stabilize variance and make data more closely resemble a normal distribution. It is particularly useful for handling non-normal data in time series.

### 2. **STL Decomposition (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess)**
   - STL decomposition is used to separate a time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and residuals. This is especially useful for forecasting and anomaly detection.

### 3. **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)**
   - WMA is a smoothing technique that gives more weight to recent observations. It is often used in time series forecasting to reduce noise and capture trends.

### 4. **VMD Decomposition (Variational Mode Decomposition)**
   - VMD is an advanced signal decomposition technique that decomposes a signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), useful for noise reduction and extracting underlying trends from complex data.
